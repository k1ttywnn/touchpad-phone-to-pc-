Touchpad for phone to pc or tablet or pc - Finger Movement Guide
==========================================

This guide explains how to use finger movements on the touchpad to control clicking and scrolling actions on your computer.

1. Clicking
-----------
- Single Finger Tap (Left Click):
  - Action: Performs a standard left mouse click.
  - How to Perform: 
    - Lightly tap the touchpad with one finger and lift it quickly (within 300 milliseconds).
    - Ensure the finger does not move more than a small distance (about 5 pixels) during the tap to avoid triggering a drag.
  - Use Case: Select items, click buttons, or interact with most UI elements.

- Two Finger Tap (Right Click):
  - Action: Performs a right mouse click (context menu).
  - How to Perform:
    - Place two fingers on the touchpad simultaneously and tap lightly, lifting both fingers quickly (within 300 milliseconds).
    - Both fingers should remain mostly stationary during the tap (no significant movement).
  - Use Case: Open context menus, access additional options in applications.

Notes on Clicking:
- The system uses a debounce mechanism to prevent multiple clicks within 300 milliseconds, ensuring single taps are intentional.
- If the tap duration exceeds 300 milliseconds or the finger moves significantly, it won’t register as a click.

2. Scrolling
------------
- Two Finger Scroll (Up/Down):
  - Action: Scrolls the content up or down.
  - How to Perform:
    - Place two fingers on the touchpad.
    - Move both fingers upward together to scroll up, or downward to scroll down.
    - The movement must be at least 10 pixels and occur within 200 milliseconds to register as a scroll gesture.
  - Use Case: Navigate through web pages, documents, or lists.

Notes on Scrolling:
- The scroll gesture is detected only when both fingers move in the same direction (mostly vertical).
- If the movement is too slow (>200ms between updates) or too small (<10 pixels), it won’t trigger scrolling.

3. Additional Gestures (Unchanged from Original)
-----------------------------------------------
- Three Finger Swipe (Left/Right):
  - Action: Switches between applications (Alt+Tab or Alt+Shift+Tab).
  - How to Perform:
    - Place three fingers on the touchpad.
    - Swipe all three fingers quickly left or right (at least 50 pixels within 300 milliseconds).
  - Use Case: Navigate between open windows or applications.

- Pinch In/Out (Two Fingers):
  - Action: Zooms out (pinch in) or zooms in (pinch out).
  - How to Perform:
    - Place two fingers on the touchpad.
    - Move them closer together (pinch in) or farther apart (pinch out) by at least 20 pixels or 15% of the initial distance.
  - Use Case: Adjust zoom levels in browsers, maps, or images.

4. Mouse Movement
-----------------
- Single Finger Drag:
  - Action: Moves the mouse cursor.
  - How to Perform:
    - Place one finger on the touchpad and slide it in any direction.
    - The cursor moves proportionally to your finger’s movement, scaled to your screen resolution.
  - Use Case: Position the cursor anywhere on the screen.

General Tips
------------
- Timing: Quick taps (<300ms) are for clicks; slower movements are for dragging or scrolling.
- Movement Threshold: Small movements (<5 pixels for clicks, <10 pixels for scrolls) are ignored to prevent accidental triggers.
- Debug Mode: Enable debug mode (?debug in URL) to see visual indicators and logs for your actions.

Troubleshooting
---------------
- If clicks don’t register: Ensure taps are quick and fingers don’t move much.
- If scrolling feels unresponsive: Move fingers faster and ensure both move together.
- Check server logs if actions fail to execute (e.g., authentication issues).
